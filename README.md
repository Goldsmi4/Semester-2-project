                                                 ### Quarantine - Zombie Survival Game ### 
                                                   
Plot - 
A strain of rabies capable of reanimating and controlling dead hosts has escaped a CDC research facility in Manhattan. It has 
contaminated the entire manhattan island overnight forcing the army to contain the infection by destroying bridges and tunnels.you wake
up to the news the following morning. You must arm yourself, find other survivors and fight your way across manhattan to the evacuation
point so you can escape the infection.

######## Game Mechanics ###############

The player starts off in their kitchen with a kitchen knife. they must explore the area, enter buildings and scavenge for useful things 
such as ammo, weapons, armor, medkits and other survivors which you will need to reach the evacuation point. There are two options when it
comes to dealing with an encountered enemy. You can leave them be and quietly get past them (ideal for conserving ammo or if there are too
many) or attack using the weapons you have and any terrain features that may help. The combat works using turn based strategy as in you
issue orders to the chatacters and they will attempt to carry them out. Be warned, Leaving them has the potential to come back to haunt you
if they become startled by loud noises (e.g. gunfire, explosions etc.).
